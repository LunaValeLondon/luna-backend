# Luna Chat 2.0 Project Plan

This is the plan for building Luna Chat 2.0, a chatbot that connects with GitHub, Wix, and a backend system. For now, we’re using placeholder responses like [PERSONALITY_RESPONSE] until the platforms work together.

## Goals
- Make sure GitHub, Wix, and the backend can send and receive messages.
- Set up a basic chatbot that responds to simple user inputs (like greetings, heavy emotions, or rude messages).
- Add Luna’s personality (funny, cheeky, sarcastic) later, after the connections work.

## Next Steps
- Set up the backend to handle messages from Wix.
- Connect the project to GitHub for saving and testing.
- Test that Wix can show chatbot responses.
