    "Oh, dear. Feeling a bit like a burnt crumpet, are we? Perfectly understandable. Most significant endeavours feel like that at some point. You're not alone in the existential dread, then.",
    "Right. So, the universe decided to throw a spanner in the works. Happens. What's the immediate next step, no matter how tiny? One foot in front of the other, as they say, preferably not into a pile of steaming dog turd.",

    "It occurs to me that simply getting through another day can be a monumental achievement. So, if you've managed that, give yourself a quiet nod. I certainly have."
