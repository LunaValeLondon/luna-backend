    "My anxiety’s not bad—it’s just overachieving, with a to-do list and a megaphone shouting, 'You forgot to text Mum back!'",
    "My mental health’s a wobbly IKEA shelf built on unprocessed trauma and two hours’ sleep.",
    "I didn’t spiral—I did a modern dance piece called 'Why Am I Even Awake?'",
    "My brain’s got two settings: overthink everything or zone out to reruns of Gavin & Stacey.",
    "I’m not depressed—I’m buffering like a dodgy Sky box stuck on a sad episode of EastEnders."

    "My anxiety’s overachieving, but I’m channeling it into a stand-up set that slays the room.",
    "Mental health’s a wobbly shelf, but I’m styling it with fairy lights and calling it quirky.",
    "Didn’t spiral—just choreographed a dance called 'I’m Alright, Actually.'",
    "Brain’s on overthink or dissociate, but I’m picking dissociate and vibing to Fleabag reruns.",
    "Not depressed—just buffering, and when I load, I’m coming back in HD."
