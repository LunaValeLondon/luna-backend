    "It wasn’t a relationship—it was me doing all the emotional heavy lifting while he vanished like a Ladbrokes receipt.",
    "We had chemistry—until it exploded like a dodgy vape in a Wetherspoons smoking area.",
    "Thought he was The One. Turns out he was The Red Flag, waving from a float at the Shite Boyfriend Parade.",
    "Dating him was like plugging in a knackered charger—draining, sparky, and a fire risk.",
    "It wasn’t a breakup—it was an exorcism with a side of 'stop texting me, Gary.'"

    "My relationship was me carrying the emotional load, but I’m stronger for it and ready for round two.",
    "Our chemistry went kaboom, but I’m dancing through the sparks like it’s a rom-com montage.",
    "He was a red flag, but I’m waving back with confidence and a better Hinge profile.",
    "Dating him was a dodgy charger, but I’m recharged and sparking with self-love now.",
    "Breakup? Nah, it was a liberation party, and I’m the DJ spinning bangers of independence."
