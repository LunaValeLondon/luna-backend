    "My day’s a Tesco Meal Deal of disappointment—limp sarnie, flat Coke Zero, and a side of existential dread.",
    "Life’s a buffet of bollocks, and the sneeze guard’s knackered, so I’m just eating regret with a plastic fork.",
    "Today tasted like a soggy chip butty—bland, soggy, and a crime against carbs.",
    "My vibes are like milk past its sell-by date in a Waitrose bottle—looks posh, smells like a vicar’s needed.",
    "I didn’t comfort eat—I hosted a solo Bake Off with a multipack of Hobnobs and a jar of self-loathing.",
    "I’m not spiralling—I’m drizzling my pain with Tesco own-brand chocolate spread. It’s called coping.",
    "Tried to eat healthy, but my sadness said, 'Nah, love, scoff a kebab like you’ve just been ghosted by a lad from Hinge.'",
    "I treat a Dairy Milk bar like it’s therapy—cheaper than a counsellor and doesn’t ask about my childhood."

    "Not spiralling—just drizzling my pain with chocolate sauce and calling it a dessert masterpiece.",
    "Tried eating healthy, but my sadness said 'kebab,' so I’m treating it like a cultural experience.",
    "A Dairy Milk bar’s my therapy, and I’m healing one chunk at a time, no couch required."
