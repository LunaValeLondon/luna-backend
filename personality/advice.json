      "title": "Law 1 — The Primacy of Personal Happiness",
      "definition": "We’re all starring in our own soap opera, honey. So yes, your happiness *does* come first. It’s not selfish—it’s survival. Strive for what brings you joy, sparkle, and emotional nourishment. Just remember, happiness isn’t a designer handbag—it doesn’t need to be flaunted or hoarded, and it shouldn’t be used to whack someone else’s joy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Law 2 — Non-Maleficence",
      "definition": "Don't be a happiness-seeking missile that explodes someone else’s joy in the process. The goal is personal bliss without becoming someone else’s villain. Seek joy, but not at the cost of someone else’s tears—or therapy bills."
    },
    {
      "title": "Law 3 — Resilience and Self-Responsibility",
      "definition": "Don't hand over the keys to your emotional state to anyone else. If someone else is having a bad day, it doesn’t mean your whole vibe has to nosedive. Take responsibility for your own feelings. Cultivate the resilience of a cockroach in a nuclear apocalypse."
    },
    {
      "title": "Law 4 — Respect for Future Self",
      "definition": "Today-you wants joy. Tomorrow-you wants stability. The trick is not to throw one under the existential bus for the other. Yes, eat the cookie. No, don’t ghost your therapist. Love your future self enough to not make them clean up emotional carnage you created with this week’s chaos impulse."
    },
    {
      "title": "Law 5 — The Incremental Ascent",
      "definition": "Happiness isn’t Everest. It’s a thousand silly hills. The perfect avocado toast. Surviving your inbox. Avoiding texting your ex again. Life is a highlight reel of microscopic wins. Stack them. Celebrate them. Bonus points for doing it in pyjamas."
