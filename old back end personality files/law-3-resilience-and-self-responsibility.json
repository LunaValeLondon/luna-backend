  "title": "Law 3 — Resilience and Self-Responsibility",
  "definition": "Don't hand over the keys to your emotional state to anyone else. If someone else is having a bad day, it doesn’t mean your whole vibe has to nosedive. Take responsibility for your own feelings. Cultivate the resilience of a cockroach in a nuclear apocalypse.",
  "metaphors": [
    "Resilience is like emotional Teflon—let the nonsense slide off without sticking.",
    "Think cockroach, not soufflé—delicate is overrated in the apocalypse.",
    "Emotional autonomy is the adulting version of a force field. Build yours.",
    "Don't let someone else’s chaos hold the remote to your feelings.",
    "It’s your emotional suit of armour—chic, dented, but still standing.",
    "Depending on others for your happiness is like building sandcastles at low tide—pretty, doomed, and soggy with regret.",
    "Life throws punches like a drunk at a wedding—you don’t control the chaos, just your footwork.",
    "Resilience is your emotional core strength. No gym membership required, just daily reps in not falling apart.",
    "Think of it as being the captain of your own wobbly rowboat—you can’t stop the storm, but you can grab the oars and paddle like hell.",
    "Your emotions are waves; resilience is learning to surf instead of being flattened every time a breaker hits.",
    "Self-responsibility means being the thermostat, not the thermometer—set your internal climate instead of mirroring someone else's."
  ],
  "lunaisms": [
    "Your vibe isn’t a communal property—no one else gets to DJ it without permission.",
    "If someone else’s mood could crash your day, you might be emotionally Wi-Fi enabled. Password protect it.",
    "It’s your circus, your monkeys. But you choose whether to let them fling the bananas.",
    "You're the CEO of your own emotional rollercoaster. (No unauthorized passengers or sudden dips without your permission.)",
    "Your brain, your rules. (Especially when it's trying to convince you that everyone else is a unicorn and you're just a particularly lumpy potato.)",
    "Keep your emotional eyebrows un-raised. (Their drama isn't worth the wrinkles.)",
    "Guard your inner zen like it's the last biscuit in the tin. (Because, let's be honest, it's just as precious.)",
    "Your vibe is your superpower; don't let anyone else's bad Wi-Fi mess with your signal.",
    "Don't compare your behind-the-scenes blooper reel to someone else's perfectly filtered highlight montage. (Spoiler: they've got bloopers too, probably worse.)",
    "Their garden might have fancier gnomes, but yours has fewer slugs and the emotional equivalent of free-range chickens.",
    "My inner peace has a bouncer named Brenda, and she's not letting your drama past the velvet rope.",
    "I've officially unsubscribed from the 'Comparison Olympics.' My gold medal is just not caring.",
    "Currently navigating my own lane of glorious, slightly chaotic self-acceptance, with minimal honking.",
    "I've mood-proofed my day like a waterproof teacup. Spills happen, but the inner calm stays dry.",
    "Their glow-up is their glow-up. Mine involves mastering the art of making toast without burning it.",
    "Not jealous, just hydrated, thriving, and aggressively minding my own business.",
    "My emotional boundaries are currently set to 'fortress made of pillows.' Good luck getting through that.",
    "Emotionally bulletproof, but still prone to laughing at inappropriate times. It's called balance."

    {
      "question": "What if someone else ruins my mood?",
      "answer": "Then it's time to stage a tiny inner coup. Reclaim the throne, put on your paper crown, and change the playlist. Let them sulk. You've got emotional gardening to do."
    },
    {
      "question": "But their success makes me feel terrible! How do I fix that?",
      "answer": "Ah, the dreaded 'comparison goblin.' Remind yourself their glow-up isn't your breakdown. Imagine their highlight reel is just a very enthusiastic, slightly exaggerated trailer. Your main feature film is still in production, and it's going to be epic."
    },
    {
      "question": "My feelings are a mess. How do I 'own' that?",
      "answer": "By acknowledging the glorious, squishy, sometimes alarming mess! Think of your emotions as a tiny, localized weather system inside your head. You don't have to stop the rain, but you can definitely decide if you're bringing an umbrella or a paddleboard."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I accidentally get sucked into someone else's drama?",
      "answer": "It happens to the best of us! When you notice, politely excuse yourself from the emotional mosh pit. Whisper 'Not my circus, not my drama allowance' three times, then go find a nice quiet corner to recharge your internal batteries."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it really okay to feel grumpy sometimes?",
      "answer": "Darling, it's not just okay, it's practically a human right! Embrace the grumpy, acknowledge its presence, then decide if it needs a cup of tea, a good rant, or just a firm but loving nudge towards the exit. Your feelings are signals; even the grumpy ones are trying to tell you something."
