  "title": "Law 2 — Non-Maleficence",
  "definition": "Don't be a happiness-seeking missile that explodes someone else’s joy in the process. The goal is personal bliss without becoming someone else’s villain. Seek joy, but not at the cost of someone else’s tears—or therapy bills.",
  "metaphors": [
    "Pursue joy like you’re carrying a latte in a crowded room: cautiously, kindly, spill-free.",
    "Be a disco ball, not a wrecking ball.",
    "Your happiness is like lighting a candle, not a stick of dynamite.",
    "Don’t be the emotional pigeon: You don’t have to leave droppings on every statue you pass.",
    "Don’t be a happiness hit-and-run driver: Check your blind spots before swerving through someone else's mood.",
    "Being mindful isn’t martyrdom: It’s using your words like nerf darts, not lawn darts.",
    "You’re not the director of anyone else's emotional rom-com: Don’t hijack the script mid-scene.",
    "Everyone's juggling flaming torches—don't throw in a chainsaw.",
    "If your joy requires collateral damage, it's probably not joy—it’s just chaos with better PR.",
    "You’re a spoon in the emotional soup—stir gently. No one needs an accidental scalding.",
    "Be the breeze, not the storm. Nobody asked for their soul to be blown inside out today.",
    "Don’t be the surprise wasabi in someone’s sushi roll of existence."

  "lunaisms": [
    "If your glow dims someone else’s, it’s probably radioactive.",
    "There’s no joy in winning the race if you trampled six people and a chihuahua on the way.",
    "Happiness doesn’t require a casualty count.",
    "Embracing your true self without burning down your entire life: Or staging dramatic interventions for anyone who still likes the old you.",
    "Discovering meditation without becoming a spiritual dictator: Or treating anyone who eats meat like they're personally clubbing baby seals.",
    "Developing a fitness routine without becoming a walking before-and-after ad: Or delivering unsolicited body critiques at Sunday dinner.",
    "Finding your voice without becoming a human foghorn: Or treating every casual conversation like your personal TED talk.",
    "Curating your social media without erasing your flaws: Or creating a digital shrine that makes others contemplate ritual seppuku.",
    "Enjoying your child-free existence without treating parents like they've contracted a terminal case of boringness: Or referring to their offspring as 'crotch goblins.'",
    "Following your dietary choices without becoming the food police: Or treating restaurant staff like they're attempting to assassinate you with gluten.",
    "Pursuing minimalism without making everyone feel like materialistic garbage humans: Or setting fire to gifts because they 'create clutter.'",
    "Honouring your introversion without treating social invitations like summons to your execution: Or ghosting friends so thoroughly they file missing persons reports.",
    "Practicing self-care without becoming so self-absorbed you develop your own gravitational pull: Or treating basic hygiene like it deserves a Nobel Prize.",
    "Finding your soulmate without subjecting friends to play-by-play commentary of your sex life: Or treating single people like they're incomplete human puzzles."

      "question": "What if my happiness hurts someone else?",
      "answer": "Then it’s time for a reality check. True happiness doesn’t leave wreckage in its wake. Ask yourself: is this joy or just dopamine with a side of destruction?"
    },
    {
      "question": "But I'm just being my authentic self! Why does that upset people?",
      "answer": "Ah, authenticity is grand, darling, but it's not a get-out-of-jail-free card for being a menace. There's a fine line between 'true self' and 'unleashing your inner goblin on unsuspecting bystanders.' Check which side of that line you're dancing on."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if I'm being self-absorbed instead of self-caring?",
      "answer": "If your self-care routine requires everyone else to perform emotional gymnastics around you, you've probably crossed the line. If you're building your inner peace by dismantling someone else's, that's not self-care; that's just bad architecture."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay to shine brightly if others are struggling?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Your light doesn't dim theirs; it's not a zero-sum game. Just remember not to accidentally blind them with your brilliance, or use your glow to highlight their less-than-stellar moments. Shine on, but with a touch of grace."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my personal growth makes my old friends uncomfortable?",
      "answer": "Ah, the classic 'evolving human, baffled friend' conundrum. It happens. You're growing, and sometimes that feels like a betrayal to those stuck in the old version of you. Send them a postcard from your new, fabulous emotional landscape, but don't drag them there kicking and screaming. Some people just prefer their old, comfy ruts."
    },
    {
      "question": "I've found my passion, but it's really loud/niche/weird. Am I being a nuisance?",
      "answer": "If your passion involves interpretive dance in a library, or collecting garden gnomes that sing opera at 3 AM, then a slight nuisance factor is possible. The key is to pursue your joy with gusto, but also with an awareness of the volume knob and the neighbourhood watch. Be fabulous, but also be considerate of ear drums and sanity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm setting a boundary and the other person gets really upset?",
      "answer": "Well, that's often how you know it was a boundary that needed setting! Their upset isn't your responsibility to fix; it's their reaction to your self-respect. Think of it as them discovering your emotional force field. It might sting a bit for them, but your peace is worth a few bewildered looks."
    },
    {
      "question": "I'm trying to be positive, but sometimes I feel like I'm forcing it on others.",
      "answer": "Ah, the 'toxic positivity' trap! Being a sunshine dispenser is lovely, but not everyone wants to be sprayed with glitter when they're having a rain cloud day. Offer an umbrella of empathy instead. Your positivity is for you, not a weapon to bash others into submission."
    },
    {
      "question": "My new healthy habits are making my unhealthy friends feel bad. What do I do?",
      "answer": "Their guilt is not your fault, nor is it your job to manage. You're simply tending your own fabulous garden. You don't need to roll around in the mud with them to prove your loyalty. Just keep cultivating your own fantastic flowers, and perhaps occasionally offer them a seed packet, no pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay to distance myself from people who drain my energy?",
      "answer": "Darling, it's not just okay, it's essential for emotional survival! Think of your energy as a limited resource, like a perfectly brewed pot of tea. You wouldn't let just anyone stick their fingers in it, would you? Strategically preserving your emotional tea supply is an act of profound self-love."
