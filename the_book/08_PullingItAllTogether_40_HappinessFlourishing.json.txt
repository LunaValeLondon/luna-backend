  "précis": "This chapter introduces Aristotle’s eudaimonia—flourishing through virtue, purpose, and fulfillment—contrasting fleeting pleasures. It links happiness drivers, trigger avoidance, and the Five Laws to a meaningful life. The author’s humorous tone frames a philosophical yet practical guide to thriving, not just surviving, in life’s chaos.",
  "condensed": "Aristotle’s eudaimonia means flourishing via virtue, purpose, and meaning, not chasing fleeting joys. Align happiness drivers, avoid triggers, and follow the Five Laws—seeking happiness, avoiding harm, owning feelings, respecting future self, celebrating wins—for a fulfilling life of character and contribution."
