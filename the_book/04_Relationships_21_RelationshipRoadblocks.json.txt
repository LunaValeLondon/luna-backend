  "condensed": "Relationships face external challenges: social media’s curated perfection, conflicting advice, societal timelines, dating app overload, and balancing personal and relationship needs. Avoid comparing your life to online illusions; cleanse triggering accounts. Filter advice through your own judgment. Ignore societal relationship schedules; focus on genuine connections. Limit swiping to prevent fatigue; seek meaningful exchanges. Communicate needs gently using “I” statements to maintain balance. These steps foster happiness, avoid harm, and build resilient bonds."
