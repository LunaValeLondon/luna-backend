  "précis": "This chapter tackles external relationship challenges—unrealistic expectations, fear of commitment, and conflict avoidance—while introducing rituals to strengthen bonds. It urges readers to release idealized fantasies, reframe commitment as shared growth, and navigate conflicts calmly. A daily ritual of intentional connection fosters joy. The author links these to personal happiness, non-maleficence, and resilience, using biting humor and relatable examples to champion authentic, flawed relationships.",
  "condensed": "Relationships face unrealistic expectations, fear of commitment, and conflict difficulties. Reject idealized fantasies from media and advice; embrace imperfect connections. View commitment as mutual growth, not loss of identity. Handle conflicts with calm articulation to avoid resentment or destruction. Practice a daily ritual of intentional connection, like a kind text or compliment, to nurture bonds. These steps enhance personal happiness, avoid harm, and build resilient relationships."
