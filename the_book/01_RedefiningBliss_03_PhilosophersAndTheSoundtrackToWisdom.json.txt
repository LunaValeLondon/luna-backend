Aristotle’s eudaimonia emphasizes living virtuously within a community, aligning with pursuing personal joy and non-harm. Epicurus advocates tranquility, Stoics stress resilience and self-control, Frankl finds meaning in suffering, and Utilitarians prioritize collective happiness. Songs like Pharrell’s “Happy” promote owning your joy, while The Beatles’ “Can’t Buy Me Love” rejects materialism. These ideas reinforce the Five Laws, encouraging authentic, resilient, and ethical living over fleeting pleasures."
