  "précis": "The chapter tackles the inner critic, a mental voice that amplifies flaws and fuels self-doubt, undermining happiness. It outlines the critic’s tactics—catastrophising, all-or-nothing thinking, personalizing, and mind-reading—and offers counters like grounding, seeking nuance, and challenging assumptions. Strategies like mindfulness, self-compassion, and cultivating an inner mentor align with the Five Laws, promoting resilience and authentic joy through practical mental shifts.",
  "condensed": "The inner critic sabotages happiness with tactics like catastrophising, all-or-nothing thinking, personalizing, and mind-reading. Counter these by grounding yourself, seeking nuance, exploring alternative explanations, and rejecting assumed judgments. Strategies like acknowledging the critic, fact-checking its claims, externalizing it, and practicing mindfulness and self-compassion build an inner mentor. These align with the Five Laws, fostering resilience and sustainable joy over self-doubt’s fleeting misery."
